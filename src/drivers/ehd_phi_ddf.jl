# One iteration: collide with the charge source, stream, rebuild the plate
# populations by non-equilibrium extrapolation, take the zeroth moment. The
# adaptive solve repeats it until its stopping rule accepts. Not exported.
#
# Issue #23: the potential (zeroth moment) can stop changing while the field,
# rebuilt from the first moment, is still relaxing from a cold start. The
# stopping rule therefore checks both moments.

    ehd_phi_ddf_step!(f_in, f_out, phi, qfield, p, xbc; phi_bottom, phi_top) -> (f_in, f_out)

One pseudo-time iteration of the DDF potential solve: collide `f_in` in place with
the source `qfield`, stream into `f_out`, rebuild the plate populations by
non-equilibrium extrapolation (`phi_bottom` at `j = 1`, `phi_top` at `j = Ny`),
and leave the zeroth moment of `f_out` in `phi`.

Returns the swapped pair: the returned `f_in` is the `f_out` just filled. Callers
rebind, `f_in, f_out = ehd_phi_ddf_step!(f_in, f_out, ...)`.

`xbc` selects the lateral treatment:
- `:neumann`: wall streaming on all four sides and extrapolation on the whole box
  (`advance!(::ECState)`);
- `:periodic`: periodic in x, walls in y, extrapolation on the plates only
  (`run_ehd_hydrostatic_2d`).

`p` is any object with the fields `eps`, `omega_U` and `nu_U`.

Inlined so that plate values given as constants by the caller reach the kernel
launch as constants: on the CPU backend a run-time `Float64` kernel argument costs
one small heap allocation per launch.

Adaptive DDF solve of the electric potential for a frozen charge `qfield`: repeat
[`ehd_phi_ddf_step!`](@ref) until the stopping rule accepts, or until `max_iter`
iterations have run.

The rule is evaluated at iteration `iter` when `iter % check_every == 0` (on
cadence) or `iter == max_iter`, with one device-to-host copy per check. It measures
- `phi_rel = max|phi - phi_prev| / max|phi|`, the relative change of the zeroth
  moment over the last iteration (`ehd_rel_change_2d!`);
- `field_rel = max|E - E_prev| / max(max|E|, E_ref)`, the relative change of the
  field rebuilt from the first moment (`compute_electric_field_2d!`) since the
  previous check, or since entry at the first check (`ehd_field_change_2d!`).
  Maxima run over all nodes and both components;
  `E_ref = |phi_bottom - phi_top| / (Ny - 1)`.

It accepts when `phi_rel <= phi_tol`, both moments are finite, the check is on
cadence and `field_rel <= field_tol`. A final check off cadence
(`max_iter % check_every != 0`) measures the field over fewer iterations and
cannot accept. `phi_tol` and `field_tol` are compared as given, without
conversion to the element type.

`field_tol` bounds a change between checks, not the error of the field. The
slowest mode of the iteration, `sin(π y / H)` between the plates with `H = Ny - 1`,
decays by `ρ ≈ 1 - p.nu_U * π^2 / H^2` per iteration; once it dominates, the
relative error of `E` at acceptance is about `κ * field_rel`, with
`κ = ρ^m / (1 - ρ^m) ≈ H^2 / (m * p.nu_U * π^2)` and `m = check_every`. `Inf`
means no field check: the rule is then `phi_rel <= phi_tol` alone, at every check,
which is the pre-#23 rule bit for bit (same exit iteration, same populations, same
`phi_rel`); it is reserved for non-regression comparisons against that rule.

Returns the swapped population pair (the solution is the returned `f_in`; callers
rebind) and `stats = (; iters, phi_rel, field_rel, converged)`:
- `iters`: iterations run (an `Int`);
- `phi_rel`, `field_rel`: their values at the last check;
- `converged`: `true` when a check accepted. `false` after `max_iter` iterations
  without acceptance; no exception is raised, each driver raises its own error.

On exit `phi` holds the zeroth moment of the returned `f_in`, and `ws.Ex`, `ws.Ey`
its field. `ws` is an [`ehd_phi_ddf_workspace`](@ref) or any `NamedTuple` with the
same fields; `p` is any object with the fields `eps`, `omega_U`, `nu_U` and
`tau_U`. `max_iter` and `check_every` are integers of at least 1.

Inlined, like [`ehd_phi_ddf_step!`](@ref), so that the caller's constant plate
values reach the kernel launches.
