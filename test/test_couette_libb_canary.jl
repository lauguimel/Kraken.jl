# Planar Couette — LI-BB + TRT canary
#
# Smoking-gun test for the double-BC bug described in
# docs/design/libb_refactor_plan.md.
#
# Setup
# -----
# Domain Nx × Ny lattice. Rows j=1 and j=Ny are flagged as solid. Rows
# j=2..Ny-1 are fluid. Links from the fluid row j=2 into the south solid
# (q=5, 8, 9) carry q_wall=0.5 (halfway cut). Links from the fluid row
# j=Ny-1 into the north solid (q=3, 6, 7) carry q_wall=0.5. The north
# wall moves at (u_top, 0); the south wall is stationary.
#
# Columns i=1 and i=Nx are ghost columns: after each step we copy
# f_out[1,:,:] ← f_out[Nx-1,:,:] and f_out[Nx,:,:] ← f_out[2,:,:] so
# that the kernel's default halfway-BB fallback at the x boundaries is
# overridden by periodicity. Sampling happens in the interior column.
#
# With q_w = 0.5 uniformly, Bouzidi's formula reduces to halfway BB +
# Ladd's moving-wall correction. The steady-state velocity profile is
# exactly linear:
#
#     u_x(y) = u_top · (y − y_bot) / (y_top − y_bot)
#
# with y_bot = 0.5 and y_top = Ny − 1.5 (the wall sits halfway between
# solid row j=1 / fluid row j=2 and between fluid row j=Ny-1 / solid
# row j=Ny). So for fluid row j (j=2..Ny-1):
#
#     u_ana(j) = u_top · (j − 1.5) / (Ny − 2)
#
# Expected behaviour
# ------------------
# CORRECT kernel: L2(u_x, u_ana) < 0.1 %, u_y ~ machine-eps, u_x > 0
# everywhere in the gap.
#
# CURRENT kernel (bug — 2026-04-15): u_x stays non-negative and u_y
# stays ≈ 0 (so the profile is 1D, as expected from the symmetry), but
# the linear profile is badly CORRUPTED in amplitude: L2_rel ≈ 47 %,
# Linf_rel ≈ 55 %. The profile is flattened — u_x at the top wall only
# reaches ~45 % of u_top instead of saturating near 100 %. This is the
# signature of the double-BC bug: part of the wall-driven momentum is
# silently cancelled by the second application of bounce-back.
#
# (The plan's original description of "u_x NEGATIVE in the bottom half"
# came from a different setup — the corruption mode here is amplitude
# loss, not sign reversal. Same root cause.)

    # V2 spec:
    #   PullHalfwayBB → SolidInert | ApplyHalfwayBBPrePhase →
    #                   Moments → CollideTRTDirect → WriteMoments
    #
    # The fix: apply the halfway-BB correction ONCE, pre-collision, via
    # substitution on the pulled populations:
    # - SolidInert puts rest-equilibrium w_q on solid cells (bounces
    #   done locally on the fluid cell via substitution, not via
    #   stored swap at the solid, removing the first bounce-back path).
    # - ApplyHalfwayBBPrePhase replaces each junk pulled pop fp_{q̄}
    #   (sourced from a solid neighbour) with f_in[i,j,q] + δ_{q̄} —
    #   a lag-1 halfway-BB estimate + Ladd moving-wall correction.
    # - CollideTRTDirect then collides on properly-reconstructed pops,
    #   and its post-collision output IS the correctly-bounced pop.
    #   NO post-collision LI-BB overwrite is needed (applying it was
    #   the second bounce-back in the legacy kernel).
    #
    # For q_w = 0.5 this reproduces Ginzburg's halfway-BB + TRT Λ=3/16
    # exactness: L2_rel < 1e-4 at any resolution on CPU Float64. On
    # Metal GPU Float32, error is limited by FP32 accumulation in
    # long-running simulations (observed drift from 6e-4 at Ny=33 to
