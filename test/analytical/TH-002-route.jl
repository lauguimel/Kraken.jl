# TH-002 — conduction `.krk` fallback: does it run the case the file describes?
#
# Reported as issue #19: the conduction branch of `_run_thermal` forwarded only
# Nx, Ny, Pr and the step count, so `nu`, `alpha` and the thermal faces given in
# the file were replaced by the driver defaults (ν = 0.05, α = ν/Pr, hot south /
# cold north). Everything below goes through `run_simulation(path)` on a `.krk`
# file, which is the path that exposed the hole.
#
# CPU Float64, non-refined `Module thermal`, case name selecting the conduction
# branch.
