# Issue #23: potential convergence does not imply field-moment convergence.
# The capacitor fixtures run the production adaptive solve
# (`Kraken.ehd_phi_ddf_solve!`) at the drivers' check cadences; since the #23
# repair its stopping rule also checks the field, and the cold starts meet the
# field gate. The same fixtures with `field_tol = Inf` (the pre-#23 rule) are the
# negative control. The public-driver check at default settings remains broken
# for a different reason (see its comment).
# CPU Float64 regression; no GPU, charge-transport or onset qualification.
# Run: julia --project test/analytical/ES-002-STOP.jl
