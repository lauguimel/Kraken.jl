# H2-004 — west/east pressure-driven channel through the public `.krk` runner.
#
# Reported as issue #18: `_apply_pressure_bc!` handled only `:east`, so a west
# pressure inlet reached a no-op and the run silently solved a different
# problem. Everything below drives the code through `run_simulation(path)` on a
# `.krk` file, which is the path a user takes; calling the driver directly is
# what let the hole survive.
#
# Generic, non-refined D2Q9 BGK route, CPU. Domain is a plain channel:
# pressure on west and east, solid south and north.
