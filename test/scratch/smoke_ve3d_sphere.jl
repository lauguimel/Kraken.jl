# Direct-call smoke for the 3D Oldroyd-B confined-sphere driver
# (run_conformation_sphere_libb_3d), ported onto release/v0.2.
#
# Tiny CPU Float64 config: R=4 sphere so the LI-BB cut links are genuinely
# exercised (a closed q_wall=0.5 box would collapse Bouzidi-FL to halfway-BB
# and hide cut-link bugs — see feedback_smoke_must_exercise_cutlinks). Low
# Wi=0.01, a few hundred steps. Mirrors the parameter relations of
# bench/viscoelastic_audit/step5_3d_diagnostic/5c_sphere_wi_sweep.jl, scaled
# down for a sub-minute CPU run.
#
# Asserts: runs NaN-free AND returns a finite drag Cd.
