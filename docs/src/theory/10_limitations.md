# Limitations of Standard LBM

The Lattice Boltzmann Method is powerful, but it comes with inherent
limitations that practitioners must understand. This page summarises the
main constraints and how to work within them
[Kruger et al. (2017)](@cite kruger2017lattice).

## Compressibility error

LBM solves a weakly compressible form of the Navier--Stokes equations.
The pressure relates to density through an equation of state:

```math
p = \rho \, c_s^2 = \frac{\rho}{3}
```

This means density fluctuations act as a proxy for pressure. The error
compared to a truly incompressible solver scales as:

```math
\text{error} = O(\mathrm{Ma}^2), \qquad \mathrm{Ma} = \frac{u}{c_s}
```

!!! warning "The Ma < 0.1 rule"
    To keep compressibility errors below 1%, the Mach number must satisfy
    ``\mathrm{Ma} < 0.1``, or equivalently ``u < 0.058`` in lattice units.
    This is the **single most important constraint** in LBM simulations.

In practice, this means the lattice velocity `u_lid`, `u_max`, or any
characteristic velocity must remain well below ``0.1``:

```julia
using Kraken

lattice = D2Q9()
cs = sqrt(cs2(lattice))
@show cs                      # ≈ 0.577

# Good: Ma = 0.1/0.577 ≈ 0.17 (borderline)
u_safe = 0.05
@show u_safe / cs

# Bad: Ma = 0.3/0.577 ≈ 0.52 (too high, results will be wrong)
u_bad = 0.3
@show u_bad / cs
```

## Stability: relaxation frequency bound

The BGK relaxation frequency must satisfy:

```math
0 < \omega < 2
```

- ``\omega \to 0``: very high viscosity, overdamped (accurate but slow).
- ``\omega \to 2``: very low viscosity, high Reynolds number (fast but
  prone to numerical instability).

In practice, ``\omega > 1.95`` almost always leads to divergence.
For stable production runs, keep ``\omega \leq 1.9``, which corresponds
to ``\nu \geq 0.00175`` in lattice units.

```math
\nu = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{\omega} - \frac{1}{2}\right) \geq 0
```

```julia
# Minimum safe viscosity
ω_max = 1.9
ν_min = (1.0/3.0) * (1.0/ω_max - 0.5)
@show ν_min  # ≈ 0.00877
```

## Why τ must be strictly greater than 1/2

The relaxation time ``\tau`` is the single most important parameter in LBM.
It controls the kinematic viscosity through the Chapman--Enskog relation:

```math
\nu = \frac{1}{3}\left(\tau - \frac{1}{2}\right) \Delta x^2 / \Delta t
```

On a standard lattice where ``\Delta x = \Delta t = 1``, this simplifies to
``\nu = (\tau - 1/2)/3``.

**Physical interpretation.** After streaming, the populations at each node
are out of equilibrium. The collision step relaxes them toward ``f^{\text{eq}}``
at a rate ``\omega = 1/\tau``. A large ``\tau`` means slow relaxation (high
viscosity, strongly damped). A small ``\tau`` means fast relaxation (low
viscosity, weakly damped).

**The ``\tau = 1/2`` singularity.** At ``\tau = 1/2`` (``\omega = 2``),
the collision step *overshoots* equilibrium and exactly mirrors the
non-equilibrium part:

```math
f^{\star} = f - 2(f - f^{\text{eq}}) = 2f^{\text{eq}} - f
```

This is an involution (applying it twice returns to the original ``f``).
There is no net dissipation — ``\nu = 0``. The simulation has zero viscosity,
meaning even the smallest perturbation is never damped and grows until the
low-Mach assumption breaks. In practice, ``\tau < 0.5`` gives **negative
viscosity** (anti-diffusion, exponential blowup).

**On non-uniform meshes.** When cells have different physical sizes
``\Delta x_{\text{local}}``, maintaining a uniform target viscosity ``\nu``
requires adjusting ``\tau`` per cell. For a global time step ``\Delta t``:

```math
\tau_{\text{local}} = \frac{3\nu \, \Delta t}{\Delta x_{\text{local}}^2} + \frac{1}{2}
= \left(\frac{\Delta x_{\text{ref}}}{\Delta x_{\text{local}}}\right)^2 (\tau_{\text{ref}} - \tfrac{1}{2}) + \frac{1}{2}
```

Large cells (``\Delta x_{\text{local}} \gg \Delta x_{\text{ref}}``) push
``\tau_{\text{local}} \to 1/2``, making those cells near-inviscid and
numerically unstable. This is the fundamental challenge of the LBM on
stretched meshes.

**Mitigations:**

| Strategy | Mechanism | Trade-off |
|:---------|:----------|:----------|
| ``\tau_{\text{floor}}`` clamp | Set ``\tau \geq 0.55`` everywhere | Adds numerical viscosity at large cells |
| Limit stretching ratio | Keep ``\max(\Delta x) / \min(\Delta x) \leq 3`` | Limits mesh flexibility |
| MRT / cumulant collision | Separate physical and ghost relaxation rates | More complex kernel, ~20% slower |
| Regularized collision | Filter non-hydrodynamic modes before relaxation | Stable at ``\tau \to 0.5``, same cost |

The regularized collision operator (Latt & Chopard 2006) is especially
effective: it reconstructs the non-equilibrium part solely from the
physical stress tensor ``\Pi^{(1)}``, discarding the higher-order
ghost modes that cause instability. The viscosity relation is unchanged,
so accuracy is preserved.

## Resolution requirements

Under grid refinement, the key constraint is that all non-dimensional
numbers (Re, Ma, Pr) must remain constant. If we refine by a factor 2
(double ``N``):

- ``\Delta x \to \Delta x / 2``
- ``u_{\text{latt}} \to u_{\text{latt}} / 2`` (to keep Ma constant)
- ``\nu_{\text{latt}} \to \nu_{\text{latt}} / 2`` (to keep Re constant)
- ``\Delta t \to \Delta t / 4`` (since ``\Delta t \propto \Delta x^2 / \nu``)

This means **doubling the resolution costs 8x in 2D** (4x more nodes,
2x more time steps) and **16x in 3D** (8x more nodes, 2x more time steps).

!!! tip "Practical consequence"
    Always run the coarsest grid that gives acceptable accuracy. Use the
    Ma < 0.1 constraint and the stability limit on ``\omega`` to choose
    the lattice velocity and viscosity.

## No adaptive mesh refinement

Standard LBM requires a **uniform Cartesian grid**. Unlike finite volume or
finite element methods, there is no straightforward way to locally refine the
mesh near walls or features of interest. Multi-block and adaptive approaches
exist but break the simplicity that makes LBM attractive.

Kraken.jl currently uses uniform grids only (AMR is planned for V2).

## Limited to low-Mach flows

Because the equilibrium distribution is a second-order Taylor expansion of
the Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution, LBM is restricted to low-Mach-number
flows. Compressible flows (shocks, supersonic regimes) require either
higher-order equilibria or fundamentally different approaches.

## Summary of constraints

| Constraint | Requirement | Consequence |
|:-----------|:------------|:------------|
| Low Mach | ``\mathrm{Ma} < 0.1`` | ``u_{\text{latt}} < 0.058`` |
| Stability | ``\omega < 2`` | ``\nu > 0`` in lattice units |
| Practical stability | ``\omega \leq 1.9`` | ``\nu \geq 0.009`` |
| Uniform grid | Cartesian, ``\Delta x = \text{const}`` | No local refinement |
| Refinement cost | ``\propto N^{D+1}`` | Expensive for high Re |

Despite these limitations, LBM remains an excellent choice for
low-to-moderate Reynolds number flows on regular geometries, especially
when GPU acceleration makes the explicit time stepping very fast.
