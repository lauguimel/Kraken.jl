# Volume-of-Fluid with PLIC Reconstruction

The **Volume-of-Fluid (VOF)** method tracks a two-phase interface using
a scalar field ``C(\mathbf{x}, t) \in [0, 1]`` representing the volume
fraction of the liquid phase in each cell.  Unlike diffuse-interface methods,
VOF maintains a sharp interface (1--2 cells wide) by combining geometric
reconstruction with conservative advection.

## Volume fraction field

Each computational cell is classified based on its volume fraction:
```math
C =
\begin{cases}
    1 & \text{liquid (full)} \\
    0 & \text{gas (empty)} \\
    0 < C < 1 & \text{interface (mixed cell)}
\end{cases}
```

The physical density and viscosity are interpolated arithmetically:
```math
\rho(C) = C\,\rho_l + (1-C)\,\rho_g, \qquad
\nu(C)  = C\,\nu_l  + (1-C)\,\nu_g
```

The volume fraction is advected by the flow velocity:
```math
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (C\,\mathbf{u}) = 0
```

Naively discretizing this advection equation with standard LBM or finite
differences leads to severe numerical diffusion that smears the interface
over many cells.  The PLIC method avoids this by using geometric
reconstruction.

## Interface normal estimation

### Youngs' method

The interface normal ``\hat{\mathbf{n}}`` in each mixed cell is estimated
from the gradient of ``C`` using the **Youngs method** (a ``3 \times 3``
weighted finite-difference stencil):
```math
\hat{\mathbf{n}} = -\frac{\nabla C}{|\nabla C|}
```

The sign convention ``\hat{\mathbf{n}} = -\nabla C / |\nabla C|`` gives
an outward normal from liquid to gas (consistent with Basilisk).

The Youngs stencil weights corner and edge neighbours:
```math
\frac{\partial C}{\partial x} \approx \frac{1}{8}
\left(C_{i-1,j-1} + 2\,C_{i-1,j} + C_{i-1,j+1}
     - C_{i+1,j-1} - 2\,C_{i+1,j} - C_{i+1,j+1}\right)
```

### Mixed Youngs--Centred (MYC)

The MYC method selects between Youngs and centred-difference normals
on a per-cell basis, choosing whichever gives a more accurate PLIC
reconstruction.  This reduces orientation-dependent errors, especially
for interfaces aligned with grid diagonals.

In Kraken.jl:
```julia
compute_vof_normal_2d!(nx, ny, C, Nx, Ny)
```

## PLIC reconstruction

Given the normal ``\hat{\mathbf{n}}`` and volume fraction ``C``, the
**Piecewise Linear Interface Calculation (PLIC)** places a line
``\hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot \mathbf{x} = \alpha`` in each mixed cell
such that the fluid area below the line equals ``C``.

The line parameter ``\alpha`` is found by inverting the exact
area-fraction relation from Scardovelli & Zaleski (2000).
In a unit cell ``[-1/2, 1/2]^2`` with normal ``(n_x, n_y)``:
```math
\alpha(C) = \begin{cases}
  \sqrt{2\,C\,n_1\,n_2}                      & C \leq \frac{n_1}{2\,n_2} \\[4pt]
  C\,n_2 + \frac{n_1}{2}                      & \frac{n_1}{2\,n_2} < C \leq 1 - \frac{n_1}{2\,n_2} \\[4pt]
  n_1 + n_2 - \sqrt{2\,n_1\,n_2\,(1 - C)}    & C > 1 - \frac{n_1}{2\,n_2}
\end{cases}
```

where ``n_1 = \min(|n_x|, |n_y|)`` and ``n_2 = \max(|n_x|, |n_y|)``.
These are the exact Basilisk `line_alpha` / `line_area` formulas,
reimplemented in Kraken.jl as branchless GPU-safe inline functions.

## VOF advection

### Operator-split geometric advection

The PLIC-based advection uses **directional splitting** (Strang splitting):
the volume fraction is advected first in ``x``, then in ``y``
(alternating order on odd/even steps to reduce directional bias).

For each face, the geometric flux is computed by evaluating the
`rectangle_fraction`: the portion of the donor cell's PLIC reconstruction
that is swept through the face during ``\Delta t``:
```math
\Phi_{\text{face}} = C_{\text{face}} \times u_{\text{face}}
```

where ``C_{\text{face}}`` is the fraction of the swept strip that is
filled with liquid, obtained from the PLIC geometry.

The **Weymouth--Yue (2010)** compression correction is applied to
maintain boundedness:
```math
C_i^{n+1} = C_i^n - (\Phi_R - \Phi_L)
           + \tilde{C}_i\,(u_R - u_L)
```

where ``\tilde{C}_i = \mathbb{1}_{C_i > 0.5}`` is frozen before the
sweeps to avoid race conditions.

In Kraken.jl:
```julia
advect_vof_plic_2d!(C_new, C, nx_n, ny_n, cc_field, ux, uy, Nx, Ny; step=1)
```

### MUSCL-Superbee TVD advection

As an alternative to geometric PLIC advection, Kraken provides a
second-order **MUSCL scheme** with the **Superbee flux limiter**:
```math
\phi(r) = \max\!\big(0,\; \min(2r, 1),\; \min(r, 2)\big)
```

Superbee is the most compressive TVD limiter, making it well-suited
for VOF transport where interface sharpness is critical.  The MUSCL
advection is algebraic (no geometric reconstruction needed) and
cheaper per time step, but produces slightly more diffusion than PLIC
over long integration times.

In Kraken.jl:
```julia
advect_vof_2d!(C_new, C, ux, uy, Nx, Ny)
```

## Height-function curvature

Accurate curvature is essential for computing surface tension forces.
The **height-function (HF)** method accumulates volume fractions along
columns perpendicular to the interface to form discrete heights ``h``,
then computes curvature from finite differences
[popinet2009accurate](@cite popinet2009accurate):
```math
\kappa = -\frac{h''}{(1 + h'^2)^{3/2}}
```

For an interface with ``|n_y| \geq |n_x|`` (more horizontal), vertical
columns of ``\pm 2`` cells are summed to give ``h(x)``:
```math
h_i = \sum_{j=-2}^{2} C(i, j_0 + j)
```

The derivatives are approximated with standard central differences:
```math
h' \approx \frac{h_{i+1} - h_{i-1}}{2}, \qquad
h'' \approx h_{i+1} - 2\,h_i + h_{i-1}
```

The height-function method achieves **second-order convergence** of
curvature, in contrast to first-order methods based on fitting or
direct differentiation of the volume fraction field.

In Kraken.jl:
```julia
compute_hf_curvature_2d!(κ, C, nx_n, ny_n, Nx, Ny)
```

## Continuum Surface Force (CSF)

Surface tension enters the momentum equation as a volume force
concentrated at the interface [brackbill1992continuum](@cite brackbill1992continuum):
```math
\mathbf{F}_\sigma = \sigma\,\kappa\,\nabla C
```

where ``\sigma`` is the surface tension coefficient, ``\kappa`` is the
curvature from the height-function method, and ``\nabla C`` localizes
the force to interface cells.  This force is added to the LBM via the
Guo forcing scheme.

In Kraken.jl:
```julia
compute_surface_tension_2d!(Fx, Fy, κ, C, σ, Nx, Ny)
```

The two-phase collision kernel handles the momentum equation with
variable density and viscosity:
```julia
collide_twophase_2d!(f, C, Fx, Fy, gx, gy, is_solid;
    ρ_l=1.0, ρ_g=0.001, ν_l=0.1, ν_g=0.1)
```

## Axisymmetric extensions

For axisymmetric flows (2D domain representing the ``r``--``z`` plane),
the curvature has an additional azimuthal component:
```math
\kappa_\text{axi} = \kappa_{2D} + \frac{n_r}{r}
```

where ``n_r`` is the radial component of the interface normal and ``r``
is the distance from the axis of symmetry.  The height-function
curvature kernel includes this correction for axisymmetric simulations.

Similarly, the VOF advection receives a geometric source term
``-C\,u_r / r`` to account for the radial expansion/contraction
of the cylindrical control volumes.

## Summary of the VOF-PLIC algorithm

Each time step for the VOF-coupled LBM proceeds as:

1. **Interface normals**: compute ``\hat{\mathbf{n}}`` from the Youngs stencil
2. **PLIC advection**: geometric flux computation with Weymouth--Yue correction
   (or MUSCL-Superbee alternative)
3. **Clamp** ``C`` to ``[0, 1]``
4. **Height-function curvature**: ``\kappa`` from column heights
5. **Surface tension force**: ``\mathbf{F}_\sigma = \sigma\,\kappa\,\nabla C``
6. **LBM collision**: two-phase MRT with variable ``\rho(C)``, ``\nu(C)``
   and Guo forcing
7. **LBM streaming**: standard pull scheme (same kernel as single-phase)
