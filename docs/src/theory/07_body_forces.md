# Body Forces: the Guo Forcing Scheme

Many flows involve external body forces: gravity in natural convection,
a pressure gradient driving channel flow, or electromagnetic forces in
magnetohydrodynamics. Adding forces to LBM is not as simple as adding
``\mathbf{F}/\rho`` to the velocity -- a naive approach introduces errors
in the viscosity. The **Guo forcing scheme**
[Guo, Zheng & Shi (2002)](@cite guo2002discrete) is the standard solution.

## The problem with naive forcing

One might add a body force by simply modifying the equilibrium velocity:

```math
\mathbf{u}^* = \mathbf{u} + \frac{\mathbf{F} \, \Delta t}{\rho}
```

However, Chapman--Enskog analysis shows this changes the recovered viscosity
and introduces a spurious ``O(\mathbf{F})`` term in the momentum equation.
The Guo scheme corrects this by adding a properly designed forcing term to the
collision operator.

## Guo forcing term

The modified collision reads:

```math
f_q^{\star} = f_q - \omega(f_q - f_q^{\mathrm{eq}})
            + \left(1 - \frac{\omega}{2}\right) F_q
```

where the discrete forcing term ``F_q`` is:

```math
F_q = w_q \left[
    \frac{(\mathbf{e}_q - \mathbf{u}) \cdot \mathbf{F}}{c_s^2}
    + \frac{(\mathbf{e}_q \cdot \mathbf{u})(\mathbf{e}_q \cdot \mathbf{F})}{c_s^4}
\right]
```

Expanding with ``c_s^2 = 1/3``:

```math
F_q = w_q \Big[
    3 \, (\mathbf{e}_q - \mathbf{u}) \cdot \mathbf{F}
    + 9 \, (\mathbf{e}_q \cdot \mathbf{u})(\mathbf{e}_q \cdot \mathbf{F})
\Big]
```

!!! note "Key result"
    The prefactor ``(1 - \omega/2)`` is essential. Without it, the forcing
    introduces a viscosity-dependent error in the recovered momentum equation.

## Corrected macroscopic velocity

With Guo forcing, the physical velocity includes a half-force correction:

```math
\rho \, \mathbf{u} = \sum_q f_q \, \mathbf{e}_q + \frac{\mathbf{F}}{2}
```

This half-step correction ensures second-order accuracy in time. Without it,
the velocity field would be ``O(\Delta t)`` off.

The equilibrium is then evaluated at this **corrected** velocity.

## Application: Poiseuille flow

A textbook validation case is pressure-driven channel flow (Poiseuille flow),
where a uniform body force ``F_x`` replaces the pressure gradient:

```math
F_x = \frac{8 \nu \, u_{\max}}{H^2}
```

with ``H`` the channel height and ``u_{\max}`` the target centreline velocity.
The analytical velocity profile is parabolic:

```math
u_x(y) = u_{\max} \left[ 1 - \left(\frac{2y - H}{H}\right)^2 \right]
```

## Kraken.jl API

The `collide_guo_2d!` kernel performs BGK collision with Guo forcing:

```julia
collide_guo_2d!(f, is_solid, ω, Fx, Fy)
```

And `compute_macroscopic_forced_2d!` recovers the corrected velocity:

```julia
compute_macroscopic_forced_2d!(ρ, ux, uy, f, Fx, Fy)
```

```julia
using Kraken

# Set up a Poiseuille-like configuration
lattice = D2Q9()
Nx, Ny = 5, 32
ν = 0.01
ω = 2.0 / (6.0 * ν + 1.0)
@show ω

# Body force to drive the flow
u_max = 0.05
H = Ny - 2  # channel height (excluding walls)
Fx = 8.0 * ν * u_max / H^2
Fy = 0.0
@show Fx
```

The `run_poiseuille_2d` driver wraps the full simulation loop including
Guo collision, periodic streaming in x, bounce-back walls in y, and
macroscopic field recovery with half-force correction.

!!! tip "Verifying the implementation"
    After convergence, compare the velocity profile against the analytical
    parabola. The L2 error should decrease as ``O(\Delta x^2)`` under grid
    refinement.
