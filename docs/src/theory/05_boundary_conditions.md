# Boundary Conditions

After streaming, some populations at boundary nodes are **unknown** because
their upstream source lies outside the domain. Boundary conditions provide
the missing information. This page covers the three main types implemented
in Kraken.jl: bounce-back, Zou--He velocity, and Zou--He pressure.

## Bounce-back (no-slip walls)

The simplest wall boundary condition reverses incoming populations:

```math
f_{\bar{q}}(\mathbf{x}_w, t+1) = f_q^{\star}(\mathbf{x}_w, t)
```

where ``\bar{q}`` denotes the direction opposite to ``q``
[Ladd (1994)](@cite ladd1994numerical).
Physically, a particle hitting the wall bounces back the way it came, which
enforces zero velocity at the wall to second-order accuracy (when the wall
is placed halfway between fluid and solid nodes).

For D2Q9, the opposite pairs are:

| ``q`` | 2 (E) | 3 (N) | 4 (W) | 5 (S) | 6 (NE) | 7 (NW) | 8 (SW) | 9 (SE) |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| ``\bar{q}`` | 4 (W) | 5 (S) | 2 (E) | 3 (N) | 8 (SW) | 9 (SE) | 6 (NE) | 7 (NW) |

## Zou--He velocity boundary

When we want to **impose a velocity** at a boundary (e.g., the moving lid in a
cavity), bounce-back alone is not enough. The Zou--He method
[Zou & He (1997)](@cite zou1997pressure) uses the known velocity to close the
system of equations for the unknown populations.

### Derivation for the north wall (lid)

At a north-wall node ``(i, N_y)``, after streaming the three populations
pointing inward (from above) are unknown: ``f_5`` (S), ``f_8`` (SW),
``f_9`` (SE). We know the wall velocity ``(u_w, 0)``.

**Step 1** -- Density from the known populations. Using
``\rho = \sum_q f_q`` and ``\rho u_y = \sum_q f_q c_{qy} = 0``
(zero normal velocity at the wall):

```math
\rho = \frac{1}{1 + u_y} \Big[
  f_1 + f_2 + f_4 + 2(f_3 + f_6 + f_7)
\Big]
```

For a stationary wall with ``u_y = 0``, this simplifies to
``\rho = f_1 + f_2 + f_4 + 2(f_3 + f_6 + f_7)``.

**Step 2** -- The unknown populations:

```math
f_5 = f_3 - \tfrac{2}{3}\,\rho\,u_y
```
```math
f_8 = f_6 - \tfrac{1}{2}(f_2 - f_4)
      + \tfrac{1}{2}\,\rho\,u_w
      - \tfrac{1}{6}\,\rho\,u_y
```
```math
f_9 = f_7 + \tfrac{1}{2}(f_2 - f_4)
      - \tfrac{1}{2}\,\rho\,u_w
      - \tfrac{1}{6}\,\rho\,u_y
```

!!! note "Sign convention"
    The signs in the Zou--He formulae depend on which wall is being treated.
    Kraken.jl provides dedicated kernels for each wall to avoid sign errors.

## Zou--He pressure boundary

For **pressure (density) outlets**, the density ``\rho_{\text{out}}`` is
prescribed and the velocity is computed from the known populations. The
algebra is analogous to the velocity case but with ``\rho`` known and
``u_n`` (normal velocity) unknown.

At an east outlet ``(N_x, j)`` with prescribed ``\rho_{\text{out}}``:

```math
u_x = 1 - \frac{f_1 + f_3 + f_5 + 2(f_2 + f_6 + f_9)}{\rho_{\text{out}}}
```

Then the unknown westward populations (``f_4, f_7, f_8``) are set using
the same Zou--He framework.

## Periodic boundaries

Periodic conditions simply wrap the streaming source index:

```math
f_q(1, j) = f_q^{\star}(N_x, j) \quad \text{(left ← right)}
```

These are handled implicitly inside `stream_fully_periodic_2d!` and
`stream_periodic_x_wall_y_2d!`.

## Kraken.jl boundary kernels

```julia
using Kraken

lattice = D2Q9()

# The opposite direction mapping used by bounce-back
opp = opposite(lattice)
for q in 1:9
    println("q=$q  →  opposite = $(opp[q])")
end
```

Available Zou--He kernels:

| Kernel | Wall | Prescribes |
|:-------|:-----|:-----------|
| `apply_zou_he_north_2d!` | North (top) | Velocity ``(u_w, 0)`` |
| `apply_zou_he_south_2d!` | South (bottom) | Velocity |
| `apply_zou_he_west_2d!` | West (inlet) | Velocity |
| `apply_zou_he_pressure_east_2d!` | East (outlet) | Density ``\rho_{\text{out}}`` |

Each kernel operates on a 1D range (the wall length) and modifies `f`
in-place. Example call for a lid-driven cavity:

```julia
apply_zou_he_north_2d!(f, u_lid, Nx, Ny)
```
