# Streaming Step

After collision updates the distributions locally, the **streaming** step
propagates them to neighbouring nodes along their respective velocity
vectors. Streaming is the non-local half of the LBM algorithm and is
responsible for information transport across the lattice
[Kruger et al. (2017)](@cite kruger2017lattice).

## Pull vs push

There are two equivalent ways to implement streaming:

- **Push** (scatter): each node *sends* its post-collision populations to
  neighbours: ``f_q(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{e}_q) \leftarrow f_q^{\star}(\mathbf{x})``.

- **Pull** (gather): each node *reads* populations from its upstream
  neighbours: ``f_q(\mathbf{x}) \leftarrow f_q^{\star}(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{e}_q)``.

!!! tip "Pull scheme on GPUs"
    Kraken.jl uses the **pull scheme**. It is preferred on GPUs because each
    thread writes to a single known memory location, avoiding write conflicts
    and enabling coalesced memory access.

## The streaming formula

For the D2Q9 lattice with velocities ``\mathbf{e}_q = (c_{qx}, c_{qy})``,
the pull-scheme streaming reads:

```math
f_q(i, j, t+1) = f_q^{\star}(i - c_{qx}, \; j - c_{qy}, \; t)
```

For example, the East population (``q = 2``, ``c_x = 1``, ``c_y = 0``) at
node ``(i, j)`` is pulled from node ``(i-1, j)``. The rest population
(``q = 1``) stays in place since ``\mathbf{e}_1 = (0,0)``.

## Concrete example

Consider streaming on a small 5x5 grid. After collision, ``f_2^{\star}``
(East) at node (2, 3) will be read by node (3, 3) during streaming:

```
 Before streaming          After streaming
 (pull from left)

 f₂*(2,3) = 0.15           f₂(3,3) = 0.15
     ·---→---·                 ·---→---·
   (2,3)   (3,3)             (2,3)   (3,3)
```

## Boundary handling

Streaming near domain boundaries requires special treatment because
upstream nodes may lie outside the domain. Common strategies:

- **Periodic boundaries**: wrap around to the opposite side of the domain.
- **Wall boundaries**: unknown incoming populations are set by bounce-back
  or Zou--He conditions (see the Boundary Conditions chapter).

In Kraken.jl, different streaming kernels handle different boundary
configurations:

| Kernel | Walls | Periodic |
|:-------|:------|:---------|
| `stream_2d!` | All four sides are walls | None |
| `stream_periodic_x_wall_y_2d!` | Top/bottom walls | Left/right periodic |
| `stream_fully_periodic_2d!` | None | All four sides |

## Interior streaming kernel

The kernel `stream_2d!` operates on interior nodes (away from boundaries).
Populations pointing into a wall are handled *after* streaming by the
boundary condition kernels. The call signature is:

```julia
stream_2d!(f_out, f_in, Nx, Ny)
```

where `f_in` holds the post-collision state and `f_out` receives the
post-streaming result. The two arrays must be distinct (double-buffering).

## Streaming with periodicity

For periodic boundaries, `stream_fully_periodic_2d!` uses modular
arithmetic so that a node at position ``(1, j)`` pulling the West
population (``q = 4``, ``c_x = -1``) reads from ``(N_x, j)``:

```math
i_{\text{src}} = \mathrm{mod1}(i - c_{qx}, \, N_x)
```

This avoids explicit ghost layers and is very efficient on GPUs.

```julia
using Kraken

lattice = D2Q9()

# Show the velocity vectors to understand streaming directions
cx = velocities_x(lattice)
cy = velocities_y(lattice)

for q in 1:9
    println("q=$q: pull from (i-$(cx[q]), j-$(cy[q]))")
end
```

## Double buffering

Because a node may be both a source and a destination during the same
streaming step, Kraken.jl uses **two separate arrays** (`f_in` and `f_out`).
After streaming, the roles are swapped for the next time step:

```
Step n:   collide(f_in → f_tmp) → stream(f_tmp → f_out)
Step n+1: collide(f_out → f_tmp) → stream(f_tmp → f_in)
```

This swap is a simple pointer exchange, not a data copy.
