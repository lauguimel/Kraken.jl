# Shan-Chen Pseudo-Potential Multiphase

The Shan-Chen model is the simplest approach to multiphase flow in the
LBM framework.  Instead of tracking an explicit interface, an
**inter-particle force** is introduced that depends on a
pseudo-potential function ``\psi(\rho)``.  Phase separation emerges
spontaneously from the interaction, without any interface reconstruction.

## Inter-particle force

The Shan-Chen interaction force at node ``\mathbf{x}`` reads:
```math
\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}) = -G\,\psi(\mathbf{x})
    \sum_\alpha w_\alpha\,\psi(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{e}_\alpha)\,
    \mathbf{e}_\alpha
```

where ``G`` is the interaction strength, ``\psi(\rho)`` is the
pseudo-potential, ``\mathbf{e}_\alpha`` are the lattice velocities,
and ``w_\alpha`` the lattice weights.  The sum runs over nearest and
next-nearest neighbours (D2Q9 or D3Q19).

- ``G < 0``: attraction → liquid-gas phase separation
- ``G > 0``: repulsion (used in multi-component models)

The force computation is a **stencil operation** with only nearest-neighbour
reads, making it ideal for GPU parallelization.

## Pseudo-potential function

The standard Shan-Chen potential is:
```math
\psi(\rho) = \rho_0 \left(1 - e^{-\rho / \rho_0}\right)
```

where ``\rho_0`` is a reference density.  At low density,
``\psi \approx \rho`` (ideal gas); at high density, ``\psi`` saturates
at ``\rho_0``, creating an effective equation of state with a van der
Waals-like loop.

```julia
compute_psi_2d!(ψ, ρ, ρ0)
```

## Equation of state

The macroscopic pressure in the Shan-Chen model is:
```math
p = \rho\,c_s^2 + \frac{G\,c_s^2}{2}\,\psi^2(\rho)
```

For ``G < 0`` (attractive interactions), this EOS can exhibit a
non-monotonic region, leading to **spinodal decomposition**: an initially
uniform density field spontaneously separates into coexisting liquid
and gas phases.

The coexistence densities ``\rho_l`` and ``\rho_g`` are determined by
the **Maxwell equal-area construction** applied to the mechanical EOS.
They depend on ``G`` and ``\rho_0``, and can be computed numerically
or looked up from tabulated values.

## Coexistence curve

For a given ``G`` and ``\rho_0``, the coexistence liquid and gas
densities can be found by solving the Maxwell equal-area condition:
```math
\int_{\rho_g}^{\rho_l} \left(p(\rho) - p_{\mathrm{sat}}\right)
    \frac{d\rho}{\rho^2} = 0, \qquad
p(\rho_l) = p(\rho_g) = p_{\mathrm{sat}}
```

In practice, this is done numerically.  For the standard exponential
pseudo-potential with ``\rho_0 = 1``, the critical ``G`` value is
approximately ``G_c \approx -4``, below which phase separation occurs.

## Thermodynamic consistency

The standard Shan-Chen model is **not thermodynamically consistent**:
the surface tension and coexistence densities cannot be independently
controlled.  This limits accuracy but makes the model extremely simple
to implement and efficient to run.

For applications requiring better thermodynamic consistency (e.g. high
density ratios, controlled surface tension), Kraken provides the
**phase-field** approach (see [Phase-Field LBM](@ref)) as an
alternative.

## Force incorporation: Guo scheme

The Shan-Chen force is incorporated into the collision step using the
**Guo forcing scheme** [guo2002discrete](@cite guo2002discrete).
The velocity used in the equilibrium is shifted by the force:
```math
\mathbf{u}^{\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{1}{\rho}\sum_\alpha f_\alpha\,
    \mathbf{e}_\alpha + \frac{\mathbf{F}}{2\rho}
```

and an additional source term is added to the collision:
```math
S_\alpha = \left(1 - \frac{\omega}{2}\right)\,w_\alpha\,
    \left[\frac{\mathbf{e}_\alpha - \mathbf{u}}{c_s^2}
    + \frac{(\mathbf{e}_\alpha \cdot \mathbf{u})}{c_s^4}\,
    \mathbf{e}_\alpha \right] \cdot \mathbf{F}
```

This ensures second-order accuracy in the recovered Navier-Stokes
equations.

## Implementation in Kraken

The Shan-Chen pipeline consists of three GPU kernels per time step:

1. **Pseudo-potential**: ``\psi(\rho)`` at each node
2. **Interaction force**: stencil sum for ``\mathbf{F}``
3. **BGK collision with Guo forcing**: standard collision + force term

```julia
compute_psi_2d!(ψ, ρ, ρ0)
compute_sc_force_2d!(Fx, Fy, ψ, G, Nx, Ny)
collide_sc_2d!(f, Fx_sc, Fy_sc, is_solid, ω)
```

All three kernels are purely local (stencil reads only) and map
directly to GPU thread blocks with no synchronization beyond the
standard kernel-launch barrier.

## Practical considerations

| Parameter | Typical range | Effect |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ``G`` | −6 to −3 | Stronger attraction → higher density ratio |
| ``\rho_0`` | 1.0 | Reference density for ``\psi`` |
| ``\omega`` | 0.5 – 1.8 | Relaxation (stability-limited near interfaces) |

!!! warning "Density ratio limitations"
    The standard Shan-Chen model is limited to density ratios up to
    roughly 10–20 before numerical instability occurs.  For higher
    density ratios (e.g. water/air ≈ 1000), use the phase-field model.

!!! note "Solid wetting"
    Contact angle control in Shan-Chen is achieved by assigning a
    pseudo-density to solid nodes, creating an effective wetting force.
    This avoids explicit contact angle boundary conditions.
