# Viscoelastic Physics API

This page documents the legacy viscoelastic and rheology API present on this branch: constitutive model types, viscosity and strain-rate helpers, legacy polymer-stress kernels, and the cylinder driver. The log-conformation finite-volume solver lives on a separate branch and is merge-pending.
