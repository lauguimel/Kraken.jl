# Platform state & checkpoints API

The resumable simulation-state contract (`AbstractSimulationState`,
`StateSnapshot`, the generic verbs) and its HDF5 checkpoint layer. See the
[Simulation state and checkpoints](../users/simulation-state-checkpoints.md)
guide for a narrative introduction and worked examples.

```

## Electroconvection state (worked example client)

`ECState`/`ECSolution` are the first client of the contract above: the 2D
electroconvection driver split into `init_state`/`advance!`/`solution`.
