## Problem Statement

Plane Poiseuille flow is the steady, fully-developed flow of a viscous fluid
between two infinite parallel plates driven by a uniform body force ``F_x``.
This is the simplest non-trivial viscous flow: no inertia effects, no
unsteadiness, no complex geometry --- just a balance between the applied
pressure gradient (or, equivalently, a body force) and viscous diffusion.

Physically, you can think of it as the flow of water through a very wide,
flat channel driven by gravity.  In experiments, the force is typically a
pressure difference between inlet and outlet, but in a periodic LBM domain
we use an equivalent body force instead.  The result is a parabolic
velocity profile, with zero velocity at each wall and a maximum at the
channel centre.

The analytical steady-state solution for the streamwise velocity is:

```math
u_x(y) = \frac{F_x}{2\nu}\, y\,(H - y)
```

where ``H`` is the effective channel height, ``\nu`` is the kinematic
viscosity, and ``y`` is the distance from the bottom wall.  The velocity is
zero at both walls (``y = 0`` and ``y = H``) and reaches its maximum
``u_{\max} = F_x H^2 / (8\nu)`` at the centreline ``y = H/2``.

### Why this test matters

Poiseuille flow validates three fundamental ingredients of the LBM solver
simultaneously:

1. **Body force implementation** --- The forcing term must correctly inject
   momentum into the distribution functions.  An incorrect forcing scheme
   produces the wrong flow rate or a non-parabolic profile.
2. **Wall boundary conditions** --- The bounce-back walls must enforce
   no-slip at the correct location (halfway between the last fluid node and
   the wall node).  A misplaced wall shifts the profile vertically.
3. **Viscosity accuracy** --- The BGK collision operator must produce the
   correct effective viscosity ``\nu = (1/\omega - 0.5)/3``.  An error in
   ``\nu`` changes the amplitude of the parabola while preserving its shape.

The Chapman--Enskog expansion of the BGK-LBM recovers the Navier--Stokes
equations to second order in the lattice spacing.  Because the Poiseuille
solution is a quadratic polynomial in ``y``, and the D2Q9 equilibrium is
itself quadratic in velocity, the LBM should reproduce the parabola with
an error that decreases as ``\mathcal{O}(\Delta x^2)``
[Qian *et al.* (1992)](@cite qian1992lattice).

## LBM Setup

| Parameter | Symbol | Value |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Lattice   | ---    | D2Q9  |
| Domain    | ``N_x \times N_y`` | ``4 \times 32`` (periodic in ``x``, walls in ``y``) |
| Viscosity | ``\nu`` | 0.1 (lattice units) |
| Body force | ``F_x`` | ``10^{-5}`` (lattice units) |
| Relaxation rate | ``\omega`` | ``1/(3\nu + 0.5) = 0.769...`` |
| Collision | --- | BGK [BGK (1954)](@cite bgk1954) |
| Forcing scheme | --- | Guo discrete forcing [Guo *et al.* (2002)](@cite guo2002discrete) |
| Wall BCs | --- | Half-way bounce-back at ``j = 1`` and ``j = N_y`` |
| Time steps | --- | 20 000 (sufficient for steady state) |

### Boundary conditions: half-way bounce-back

In the half-way bounce-back scheme, the physical wall is located **halfway**
between the first/last fluid node and the boundary node.  This means the
effective channel height is ``H = N_y - 1``, and the physical coordinate of
fluid node ``j`` is ``y = j - 1.5``.  Fluid nodes occupy indices
``j = 2, \ldots, N_y - 1``.

### Forcing scheme: Guo's method

Naive forcing (simply adding ``F_x`` to the velocity after collision)
introduces a viscosity-dependent error in the body force.
[Guo *et al.* (2002)](@cite guo2002discrete) showed that the forcing
term must be added at the level of the **distribution functions**, not the
macroscopic velocity.  Their scheme adds a source term to each ``f_i``
that depends on the local velocity, the force, and the lattice weights.
This eliminates the spurious viscosity dependence and recovers the correct
Navier--Stokes equations to second order.

### Stability constraint

The relaxation rate must satisfy ``0 < \omega < 2``, which translates to
``\nu > 0``.  For our parameters, ``\omega \approx 0.77``, well within the
stable range.  Additionally, the body force must be small enough that the
resulting velocity remains much less than the lattice speed of sound
``c_s = 1/\sqrt{3} \approx 0.577`` to keep the Mach number low.

## Geometry

![Poiseuille flow geometry.  The domain is periodic in x and bounded by half-way bounce-back walls (grey) at y = 0 and y = H.  The uniform body force Fx drives the flow from left to right, producing a parabolic velocity profile (blue arrows) with zero velocity at the walls and maximum at the centreline.](poiseuille_geometry.svg)

## Simulation File

Download: [`poiseuille.krk`](../assets/krk/poiseuille.krk)

```
# Poiseuille flow driven by body force
# Validation: parabolic profile ux(y) = Fx/(2*nu) * y * (Ly - y)

Simulation poiseuille D2Q9
Domain  L = 0.125 x 1.0  N = 4 x 32
Physics nu = 0.1  Fx = 1e-5

Boundary x periodic
Boundary south wall
Boundary north wall

Run 10000 steps
Output vtk every 2000 [rho, ux, uy]
```

The `.krk` file is a human-readable configuration for Kraken.jl.  The key
directives are:

- **`Physics nu = 0.1 Fx = 1e-5`**: sets the viscosity and the body force.
  Kraken internally converts ``F_x`` to the Guo forcing term.
- **`Boundary south wall` / `Boundary north wall`**: applies half-way
  bounce-back at the bottom and top boundaries.
- **`Boundary x periodic`**: wraps the domain in the streamwise direction,
  so the flow is infinitely long without inlet/outlet effects.

## Code

```julia
using Kraken

Ny = 32
ν  = 0.1
Fx = 1e-5

ρ, ux, uy, config = run_poiseuille_2d(; Nx=4, Ny=Ny, ν=ν, Fx=Fx, max_steps=20000)
```

## Results --- Velocity Profile

We extract the velocity profile along a vertical line (here at ``x = 2``)
and compare it to the analytical parabola.  Because the flow is periodic
in ``x`` and fully developed, the profile is the same at every ``x``
location.

```julia
H = Ny - 1                                  # effective channel height
j_fluid = 2:Ny-1                             # fluid node indices
y_phys  = [j - 1.5 for j in j_fluid]        # physical y coordinate
u_ana   = [Fx / (2ν) * y * (H - y) for y in y_phys]
u_num   = [ux[2, j] for j in j_fluid]       # numerical profile at x=2
```

![Poiseuille flow velocity profile at Ny = 32.  Blue line: analytical parabola ux(y) = Fx/(2 nu) y (H - y).  Orange dots: LBM simulation.  The agreement is excellent, with the numerical solution overlapping the analytical curve at every fluid node.  The profile is zero at both walls and reaches its maximum at the channel centreline y = H/2 = 15.5.](poiseuille_profile.svg)

The LBM solution matches the analytical parabola to high accuracy.  At this
resolution (``N_y = 32``), the relative ``L_2`` error is typically of order
``10^{-4}`` to ``10^{-3}``.  The residual error comes from the finite
lattice spacing: the BGK collision operator approximates the viscous stress
tensor via a second-order Taylor expansion, which introduces an
``\mathcal{O}(\Delta x^2)`` truncation error.

---

## Convergence Study

To confirm the expected second-order convergence, we run the simulation at
four resolutions: ``N_y \in \{16, 32, 64, 128\}``.  At each resolution, we
compute the relative ``L_2`` error between the numerical and analytical
profiles:

```math
E_{L_2} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_j (u_j^{\text{num}} - u_j^{\text{ana}})^2}
                      {\sum_j (u_j^{\text{ana}})^2}}
```

On a log-log plot, second-order convergence appears as a straight line with
slope ``-2``: doubling the resolution divides the error by four.

```julia
Ny_list = [16, 32, 64, 128]
errors  = Float64[]

for Ny_i in Ny_list
    ρ_i, ux_i, _, _ = run_poiseuille_2d(; Nx=4, Ny=Ny_i, ν=ν, Fx=Fx, max_steps=30000)
    H_i    = Ny_i - 1
    jf     = 2:Ny_i-1
    u_a    = [Fx / (2ν) * (j - 1.5) * (H_i - (j - 1.5)) for j in jf]
    u_n    = [ux_i[2, j] for j in jf]
    L2     = sqrt(sum((u_n .- u_a).^2) / sum(u_a.^2))
    push!(errors, L2)
end
```

![Convergence of the Poiseuille flow simulation.  Log-log plot of relative L2 error vs grid resolution Ny.  Blue dots with solid line: LBM results.  Grey dashed line: reference slope of 2.  The LBM errors follow the slope-2 line closely, confirming second-order spatial convergence as predicted by the Chapman-Enskog analysis.](poiseuille_convergence.svg)

The convergence plot confirms clean second-order behaviour: each doubling of
``N_y`` reduces the error by approximately a factor of 4.  This is a direct
consequence of the Chapman--Enskog expansion, which shows that the BGK
collision operator recovers the Navier--Stokes equations with a truncation
error proportional to ``\Delta x^2``
[Kruger *et al.* (2017)](@cite kruger2017lattice).

At the finest resolution (``N_y = 128``), the relative error drops below
``10^{-5}``, demonstrating that the body force implementation, bounce-back
walls, and collision operator are all correctly implemented.
