# Species Diffusion


## Problem Statement

Pure diffusion of a passive scalar concentration ``C`` between two parallel
plates held at fixed concentrations ``C_{\text{south}} = 1`` and
``C_{\text{north}} = 0``.  The flow is quiescent (``\mathbf{u} = 0``), so
the problem reduces to the 1D steady diffusion equation:

```math
\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial y^2} = 0
```

with the analytical solution:

```math
C(y) = 1 - \frac{y}{H}
```

where ``H = N_y`` is the channel height.  This is a linear profile from
``C = 1`` at the bottom wall to ``C = 0`` at the top wall.

### Double-distribution function approach

The species concentration is tracked by a separate set of D2Q9 populations
``h_q`` with its own relaxation parameter ``\omega_D = 1/(3D + 0.5)``,
where ``D`` is the mass diffusivity.  The equilibrium includes only the
first-order velocity term:

```math
h_q^{\text{eq}} = w_q\,C\left(1 + \frac{\mathbf{c}_q \cdot \mathbf{u}}{c_s^2}\right)
```

Fixed-concentration boundary conditions use the anti-bounce-back method
(Dirichlet BC for the scalar field).

### Why this test matters

This test validates:

1. **Species collision kernel** --- [`collide_species_2d!`](@ref) must
   correctly relax ``h_q`` towards the scalar equilibrium.
2. **Concentration recovery** --- [`compute_concentration_2d!`](@ref) must
   sum the populations to recover ``C``.
3. **Dirichlet BCs** --- The anti-bounce-back scheme must impose the correct
   wall concentrations.
4. **Mesh convergence** --- The error should decrease as ``\mathcal{O}(\Delta x^2)``.

For details on the species transport model see
[Theory --- Species Transport](@ref).

## Code

```julia
using Kraken

Nx, Ny = 4, 32
D_coeff = 0.1
ω_D = 1.0 / (3.0 * D_coeff + 0.5)

# Species populations (D2Q9)
h_in  = zeros(Float64, Nx, Ny, 9)
h_out = zeros(Float64, Nx, Ny, 9)
C     = zeros(Float64, Nx, Ny)
ux    = zeros(Float64, Nx, Ny)
uy    = zeros(Float64, Nx, Ny)

# Initialize to uniform C = 0.5
w = Kraken.weights(D2Q9())
for j in 1:Ny, i in 1:Nx, q in 1:9
    h_in[i, j, q] = w[q] * 0.5
end
copy!(h_out, h_in)

# Time stepping
for step in 1:5000
    Kraken.stream_periodic_x_wall_y_2d!(h_out, h_in, Nx, Ny)
    apply_fixed_conc_south_2d!(h_out, 1.0, Nx)
    apply_fixed_conc_north_2d!(h_out, 0.0, Nx, Ny)
    collide_species_2d!(h_out, ux, uy, ω_D)
    h_in, h_out = h_out, h_in
end

compute_concentration_2d!(C, h_in)
```

## Results --- Concentration Profile

We compare the numerical profile at ``x = 2`` to the analytical linear
solution.

```julia
C_profile    = C[2, :]
C_analytical = [1.0 - (j - 0.5) / Ny for j in 1:Ny]
```

## Convergence Study

We run the diffusion problem at four resolutions and verify second-order
convergence.

```math
E_{L_2} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_j (C_j^{\text{num}} - C_j^{\text{ana}})^2}
                      {\sum_j (C_j^{\text{ana}})^2}}
```

```julia
Ny_list = [8, 16, 32, 64]
errors  = Float64[]

for Ny_i in Ny_list
    h_i  = zeros(Float64, 4, Ny_i, 9)
    h_o  = zeros(Float64, 4, Ny_i, 9)
    ux_i = zeros(Float64, 4, Ny_i)
    uy_i = zeros(Float64, 4, Ny_i)
    C_i  = zeros(Float64, 4, Ny_i)

    for j in 1:Ny_i, i in 1:4, q in 1:9
        h_i[i, j, q] = w[q] * 0.5
    end
    copy!(h_o, h_i)

    for step in 1:8000
        Kraken.stream_periodic_x_wall_y_2d!(h_o, h_i, 4, Ny_i)
        apply_fixed_conc_south_2d!(h_o, 1.0, 4)
        apply_fixed_conc_north_2d!(h_o, 0.0, 4, Ny_i)
        collide_species_2d!(h_o, ux_i, uy_i, ω_D)
        h_i, h_o = h_o, h_i
    end

    compute_concentration_2d!(C_i, h_i)
    C_num = C_i[2, :]
    C_ana = [1.0 - (j - 0.5) / Ny_i for j in 1:Ny_i]
    L2 = sqrt(sum((C_num .- C_ana).^2) / sum(C_ana.^2))
    push!(errors, L2)
end
```
