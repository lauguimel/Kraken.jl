# Viscoelastic Channel Flow (Oldroyd-B)


## Problem Statement

Fully developed channel flow of an Oldroyd-B viscoelastic fluid driven by a
body force ``F_x``.  The Oldroyd-B model splits the total stress into a
Newtonian solvent contribution (viscosity ``\nu_s``) and a polymeric
contribution described by the conformation tensor ``\mathbf{C}``:

```math
\boldsymbol{\tau}_p = G\,(\mathbf{C} - \mathbf{I}), \qquad
G = \frac{\nu_p}{\lambda}
```

where ``\nu_p`` is the polymeric viscosity, ``\lambda`` is the relaxation
time, and ``G`` is the elastic modulus.

### Analytical solution

At steady state, the velocity profile is identical to the Newtonian
Poiseuille solution with the **total** viscosity ``\nu = \nu_s + \nu_p``:

```math
u_x(y) = \frac{F_x}{2\nu}\, y\,(H - y)
```

The first normal stress difference, however, is non-zero and quadratic in
the shear rate:

```math
N_1(y) = \tau_{xx} - \tau_{yy} = 2\,\nu_p\,\lambda\,\dot\gamma(y)^2
```

where ``\dot\gamma(y) = F_x\,(H/2 - y)/\nu``.  At the centreline
``\dot\gamma = 0`` and ``N_1 = 0``; near the walls ``N_1`` reaches its
maximum.

### Log-conformation method

Direct evolution of ``\mathbf{C}`` is numerically unstable at high
Weissenberg numbers.  Kraken.jl uses the **log-conformation** approach
of [Fattal & Kupferman (2004)](@cite fattal2004constitutive): the
evolution equation is reformulated for ``\boldsymbol{\Theta} = \log\mathbf{C}``,
which is unconditionally symmetric positive-definite.

The kernel [`evolve_logconf_2d!`](@ref) advances ``\boldsymbol{\Theta}`` by
one time step, and [`compute_stress_from_logconf_2d!`](@ref) recovers the
polymeric stress via matrix exponentiation.  See
[Theory --- Viscoelastic Flows](@ref) for the full derivation.

### Why this test matters

The viscoelastic Poiseuille test validates:

1. **Log-conformation evolution** --- ``\boldsymbol{\Theta}`` must converge
   to the correct steady-state conformation tensor.
2. **Stress recovery** --- ``\boldsymbol{\tau}_p`` must match the analytical
   ``N_1`` profile.
3. **Coupling** --- The polymeric stress divergence must feed back correctly
   into the momentum equation without altering the Newtonian velocity profile.

## Results --- Velocity and N1 Profiles

### Velocity profile

The velocity profile is identical to the Newtonian case with ``\nu = \nu_s + \nu_p``.

```julia
H = Float64(Ny)
u_analytical = [Fx_val / (2 * ν_total) * (j - 0.5) * (H + 0.5 - j) for j in 1:Ny]
u_numerical  = ux[2, :]
```

![Oldroyd-B channel velocity profile.  Blue: analytical Poiseuille with total viscosity.  Orange: LBM with log-conformation.  The profiles overlap, confirming that the polymeric stress does not alter the steady-state velocity.](viscoelastic_velocity.svg)

### First normal stress difference

``N_1 = \tau_{xx} - \tau_{yy}`` is quadratic in ``\dot\gamma`` and vanishes
at the centreline.

```julia
N1_numerical = tau_p_xx[2, :] .- tau_p_yy[2, :]

N1_analytical = zeros(Ny)
for j in 1:Ny
    γ_dot = Fx_val / ν_total * abs((j - 0.5) - H / 2)
    N1_analytical[j] = 2 * ν_p * lambda * γ_dot^2
end
```

![First normal stress difference N1 across the channel.  Blue: analytical 2 nu_p lambda gamma_dot^2.  Orange: LBM.  N1 is zero at the centreline and maximum near the walls, confirming correct viscoelastic stress computation.](viscoelastic_N1.svg)

The numerical ``N_1`` profile closely follows the analytical prediction.
At the centreline ``\dot\gamma = 0`` and ``N_1 \approx 0``; near the walls
``N_1`` grows quadratically.  Small deviations near the wall nodes are
expected due to the bounce-back boundary discretisation.
