# # Static Droplet --- Laplace Pressure & Spurious Currents
#
#
# ## Problem Statement
#
# A circular droplet at rest in a quiescent fluid is the canonical test for
# surface tension accuracy in multiphase solvers.  In equilibrium, the
# **Laplace law** relates the pressure jump across the interface to the
# curvature:
#
# ```math
# \Delta p = p_\text{in} - p_\text{out} = \frac{\sigma}{R}
# ```
#
# where ``\sigma`` is the surface tension coefficient and ``R`` is the droplet
# radius.  Any deviation from this law indicates an error in the curvature
# computation or the surface tension force model.
#
# ### Spurious currents
#
# In a perfect continuous formulation, a circular droplet at rest would remain
# exactly stationary: the surface tension force is balanced by the pressure
# gradient, and the velocity is identically zero.  However, on a discrete
# lattice, the curvature computed from the VOF field ``C`` is not perfectly
# uniform along the interface.  These **discrete curvature errors** create
# local force imbalances that drive small **parasitic velocities** near the
# interface, known as **spurious currents**.
#
# Spurious currents are a fundamental issue in all multiphase methods (VOF,
# level-set, diffuse interface).  Their magnitude depends on:
#
# - The **curvature computation method**: height-function (HF) gives
#   second-order accurate curvature on Cartesian grids; finite-difference
#   methods are less accurate
# - The **force model**: the CSF (Continuum Surface Force) model
#   ``\mathbf{F} = \sigma\kappa\nabla C`` localises the force at the
#   interface via the VOF gradient
# - The **interface resolution**: more cells across the interface reduce
#   curvature errors
#
# This test quantifies both the Laplace pressure accuracy and the spurious
# current magnitude.  It is a standard Gerris/Basilisk validation case
# ([Popinet 2009](@cite popinet2009accurate)).
#
# ### VOF curvature vs CLSVOF curvature
#
# Two curvature computation strategies are available in Kraken.jl:
#
# - **VOF with height-function (HF) curvature**: the height function is
#   computed by summing ``C`` values along columns perpendicular to the
#   interface.  Curvature is then obtained from finite differences of the
#   height function.  This method is second-order accurate but can be noisy
#   near under-resolved regions where the stencil fails.
#
# - **CLSVOF with level-set (LS) curvature**: the level-set field ``\phi``
#   (a smooth signed distance function) is used to compute curvature as
#   ``\kappa = \nabla \cdot (\nabla\phi / |\nabla\phi|)``.  Because
#   ``\phi`` is smooth by construction (redistanced at each step), the
#   curvature is inherently less noisy.  The force is still applied using the
#   VOF gradient ``\nabla C`` for precise localisation.

#
# ## Geometry
#
# A smooth circular droplet (``\tanh`` profile, width ``\approx 2`` cells) of
# radius ``R = N/4`` sits at the centre of a fully-periodic
# ``N \times N`` box.  The density ratio is ``\rho_l / \rho_g = 1000``.

# region around the droplet.  This improves the curvature computation where

#
# ![Three-panel view.  Left: volume fraction C with the C = 0.5 contour (red).  Centre: pressure profile along the y-centreline showing the Laplace pressure jump at the interface (red dashed lines).  Right: velocity magnitude field showing spurious currents concentrated at the interface.](droplet_vof_results.svg)
#
# The pressure profile (centre panel) shows a clear **step** at the interface:
# the pressure inside the droplet is higher than outside, consistent with the
# Laplace law.  The step is sharp (``\approx 2`` cells wide), confirming that
# the ``\tanh`` initialisation produces a well-resolved interface.
#
# The velocity field (right panel) reveals the **spurious currents**: small
# parasitic velocities localised at the interface, forming a quadrupolar
# pattern aligned with the lattice axes.  These currents are an artefact of
# the discrete curvature computation and do not correspond to any physical
# flow.  Their magnitude (typically ``10^{-4}`` to ``10^{-3}`` in lattice
# units) sets the noise floor for any simulation involving surface tension.

# both VOF and CLSVOF, keeping the ratio ``R/N = 1/4`` constant.  The maximum
# spurious velocity is measured after 5000 steps of relaxation.

# ![Convergence of maximum spurious velocity vs grid resolution N on a log-log scale.  Blue: VOF with height-function curvature.  Coral: CLSVOF with level-set curvature.  CLSVOF consistently produces lower spurious currents at all resolutions.](droplet_convergence.svg)
#
# The key observations from the convergence plot:
#
# - **CLSVOF produces lower spurious currents** than VOF at all resolutions.
#   The smooth level-set field ``\phi`` yields a more uniform curvature along
#   the interface, reducing the force imbalances that drive parasitic
#   velocities.
#
# - **Both methods converge** with grid refinement: spurious currents decrease
#   as the interface becomes better resolved.  The convergence rate is
#   approximately second order for VOF (HF curvature) and slightly better for
#   CLSVOF.
#
# - The **`Refine` block** in the `.krk` file (not used in this convergence
#   study) can further improve curvature accuracy by locally doubling the
#   resolution around the droplet, achieving the benefits of a finer grid
#   without the full cost.
#
# ### Practical implications
#
# For simulations where spurious currents must be minimised (e.g., slow
# capillary flows, droplet coalescence), CLSVOF with level-set curvature is
# the recommended approach.  For faster flows where the physical velocities
# are much larger than the parasitic velocities, the simpler VOF method with
# height-function curvature is usually sufficient.
