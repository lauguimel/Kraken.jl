# # Zalesak Disk --- VOF Advection Test
#
#
# ## Problem Statement
#
# The Zalesak disk test [Zalesak (1979)](@cite zalesak1979fully) is a classic
# benchmark for **Volume of Fluid (VOF)** interface advection schemes.  It is
# the first test any multiphase code should pass: a notched disk undergoes
# rigid-body rotation in a prescribed velocity field, and after one full
# revolution the disk must return to its initial position.  Any deviation
# quantifies numerical diffusion and geometric distortion introduced by the
# advection algorithm.
#
# ### What is VOF?
#
# The Volume of Fluid method tracks a phase indicator ``C(\mathbf{x}, t)``
# defined in each cell:
#
# - ``C = 1``: liquid (or primary phase)
# - ``C = 0``: gas (or secondary phase)
# - ``0 < C < 1``: the cell contains the interface
#
# The field ``C`` is transported by the flow via an advection equation:
#
# ```math
# \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (C\,\mathbf{u}) = 0
# ```
#
# In Kraken.jl, this equation is solved using **directional splitting** with a
# first-order upwind scheme: the ``x``- and ``y``-fluxes are computed
# separately, alternating the sweep direction each step to reduce directional
# bias.  Because the scheme is written in conservative (flux) form, **total
# volume is preserved to machine precision** --- this is the key advantage of
# VOF over level-set methods.
#
# ### Why this test matters
#
# This test exercises **only** the VOF advection kernel --- no LBM flow solver,
# no surface tension, no collision operator.  The velocity field is prescribed
# analytically (rigid rotation), so any error comes exclusively from the
# advection scheme.  The notched disk is deliberately challenging: it has sharp
# corners at the slot edges that are rapidly smeared by numerical diffusion.
# Measuring how much the slot rounds off after one revolution directly
# quantifies the scheme's shape-preservation capability.
#
# The prescribed velocity field for rigid rotation about ``(x_0, y_0)`` is:
#
# ```math
# u_x = -\omega\,(y - y_0), \qquad
# u_y =  \omega\,(x - x_0)
# ```
#
# where ``\omega = 2\pi / T`` is the angular velocity and ``T`` is the period
# of one rotation.
#
# ---
#
# ## Geometry
#
# The notched disk of radius ``R = 15`` sits at ``(50, 75)`` in a
# ``100 \times 100`` periodic box.  The rectangular slot has width 5 and
# extends downward from the disk centre.

# `advection` test.

using Kraken

N  = 100
R  = 15.0
cx, cy  = 50.0, 75.0
slot_w  = 5.0

angular_vel = 2π / (N * π)
max_steps   = round(Int, 2π / angular_vel)  # one full rotation

function zalesak_init(x, y)
    r = sqrt((x - cx)^2 + (y - cy)^2)
    disk = 0.5 * (1 - tanh((r - R) / 2))
    in_slot = abs(x - cx) < slot_w / 2 && y < cy && y > cy - R
    return in_slot ? 0.0 : disk
end

velocity_fn(x, y, t) = (-(y - 50.0) * angular_vel, (x - 50.0) * angular_vel)

result = run_advection_2d(; Nx=N, Ny=N, max_steps=max_steps,
                           velocity_fn=velocity_fn, init_C_fn=zalesak_init)

#
# After one complete revolution, the disk returns approximately to its original
# position.  However, the sharp corners of the rectangular slot have been
# noticeably rounded by numerical diffusion --- a well-known limitation of
# first-order upwind VOF.  The slot appears wider and shallower than the
# original.  The outer disk boundary, being smooth, is much better preserved.
#

#
# ## Shape Error Analysis
#
# We quantify the error using the ``L_1`` norm of the difference between the
# initial and final volume fraction fields, normalised by the total initial
# volume:
#
# ```math
# E_{L_1} = \frac{\sum_{i,j} |C_{i,j}(T) - C_{i,j}(0)|}{\sum_{i,j} C_{i,j}(0)}
# ```

L1_err = sum(abs.(result.C .- result.C0)) / sum(result.C0)
mass_err = abs(result.mass_history[end] - result.mass_history[1]) / result.mass_history[1]
nothing #hide

# ![Local error map |C(T) - C(0)| showing where the shape has changed.  The inferno colour scale highlights the slot corners (largest error) and the trailing edge of the disk.](zalesak_error_map.svg)
#
# The error map reveals that the largest deviations occur at the **slot
# corners**, where the initial sharp 90-degree angles are smeared into smooth
# curves.  The trailing edge of the disk (in the direction of rotation) also
# shows some diffusion.  The interior of the disk and the exterior region
# remain essentially unchanged.
#

#
# ## Convergence Study
#
# To verify that the error decreases with grid refinement, we run the test at
# three resolutions (``N = 50, 100, 200``), scaling the geometry proportionally
# so that the disk always occupies the same fraction of the domain.

N_list = [50, 100, 200]
errors = Float64[]

for Ni in N_list
    ω_i = 2π / (Ni * π)
    steps_i = round(Int, 2π / ω_i)
    cx_i, cy_i = Ni / 2, 3Ni / 4
    R_i = 0.15 * Ni
    w_i = 0.05 * Ni

    init_i(x, y) = begin
        r = sqrt((x - cx_i)^2 + (y - cy_i)^2)
        disk = 0.5 * (1 - tanh((r - R_i) / 2))
        in_slot = abs(x - cx_i) < w_i / 2 && y < cy_i && y > cy_i - R_i
        in_slot ? 0.0 : disk
    end
    vel_i(x, y, t) = (-(y - Ni / 2) * ω_i, (x - Ni / 2) * ω_i)

    res = run_advection_2d(; Nx=Ni, Ny=Ni, max_steps=steps_i,
                            velocity_fn=vel_i, init_C_fn=init_i)

end

# ![Convergence plot showing L1 shape error vs grid resolution N on a log-log scale.  The VOF scheme follows approximately a slope-1 line (first-order convergence).](zalesak_convergence.svg)
#
# The first-order upwind VOF scheme converges at approximately **order 1**: the
# error halves when the resolution doubles.  This is expected from the
# directional-split upwind discretisation.  Higher-order flux limiters (MUSCL,
# THINC) or unsplit geometric advection would improve this to second order, but
# are not yet implemented in Kraken.jl.
#
# ### Mass Conservation
#
# Regardless of the shape error, the directional-split advection is
# **inherently conservative**: total volume fraction ``\sum C`` is preserved to
# machine precision (``\sim 10^{-15}`` relative error) at all resolutions.
# This is a fundamental property of the flux-based VOF formulation and holds
# even for the first-order scheme.
