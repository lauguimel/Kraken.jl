#

#
# ## Problem Statement
#
# The lid-driven cavity is *the* canonical benchmark for incompressible flow
# solvers.  It has appeared in virtually every CFD textbook since the 1960s
# and remains the standard first test for any new Navier--Stokes code.
#
# ### Setup
#
# A square box of side ``N`` is bounded by solid walls on all four sides.
# Three walls are stationary (no-slip), while the **top wall (lid)** moves
# horizontally at constant velocity ``u_\text{lid}``.  The lid drags fluid
# underneath it by viscous shear, creating a recirculating flow inside the
# cavity.
#
# The single governing parameter is the **Reynolds number**:
#
# ```math
# \text{Re} = \frac{u_\text{lid} \cdot N}{\nu}
# ```
#
# where ``\nu`` is the kinematic viscosity.
#
# ### What happens physically?
#
# At ``\text{Re} = 100``, a **single primary vortex** occupies most of the
# cavity, centred slightly above and to the right of the geometric centre.
# Two tiny secondary vortices appear in the bottom corners, but they are
# barely visible at this Reynolds number.  As Re increases, the primary
# vortex migrates toward the centre and the corner vortices grow.
#
# ### Why this test matters
#
# The lid-driven cavity is a **combined test** of the entire LBM solver:
#
# - **Streaming** must correctly propagate populations in all 9 directions
# - **Collision** (BGK) must recover the correct viscous stress tensor
# - **Zou--He velocity BC** on the lid must impose a non-zero tangential
#   velocity without generating spurious density fluctuations
# - **Half-way bounce-back** on the three stationary walls must enforce
#   no-slip at the correct location (half a lattice spacing from the node)
# - The solver must handle a **recirculating flow** (no inlet/outlet),
#   which is more demanding than channel flows
#
# Reference data for the centreline velocity profiles was published by
# [Ghia *et al.* (1982)](@cite ghia1982high), who used a vorticity-stream
# function method with a very fine grid.  Their digitised data points at
# ``\text{Re} = 100`` are the gold standard for validation.

#
# ## Geometry
#
# ![Schematic of the lid-driven cavity.  The top wall moves at velocity u_lid (Zou-He BC), while the three other walls are stationary (half-way bounce-back).  A single primary vortex forms in the interior.](cavity_geometry.svg)
#

#
# ## LBM Setup
#
# | Parameter | Value |
# |-----------|-------|
# | Lattice   | D2Q9  |
# | Domain    | ``128 \times 128`` |
# | Lid BC    | Zou--He velocity, ``u_\text{lid} = 0.1`` |
# | Other walls | Half-way bounce-back (no-slip) |
# | ``\text{Re}`` | 100 |
# | ``\nu``   | ``u_\text{lid} \cdot N / \text{Re} = 0.128`` |
# | ``\omega`` | ``1/(3\nu + 0.5) \approx 1.19`` |
# | Steps     | 60 000 |
#
# The relaxation parameter ``\omega`` is comfortably in the stable range
# ``(0, 2)``.  The Mach number ``\text{Ma} = u_\text{lid} / c_s = 0.1\sqrt{3}
# \approx 0.17`` is low enough for the incompressible approximation to hold.

# 2. **Bounce-back** on the three stationary walls
# 3. **Zou--He** on the top wall (impose ``u_x = u_\text{lid}``, ``u_y = 0``)
# 4. **Collide** --- BGK relaxation toward equilibrium
# 5. **Compute macroscopic** ``\rho``, ``u_x``, ``u_y`` from populations
#
# After 60 000 steps the flow is fully converged to steady state.

# ## Post-processing
#
# Extract the LBM velocity profiles along the centrelines.  The velocity
# is normalised by ``u_\text{lid}`` and the coordinates by ``N`` so that
# both range from 0 to 1, matching the Ghia convention.

mid = N ÷ 2 + 1

## Vertical centreline: ux(y) at x = N/2
ux_profile = [ux[mid, j] / u_lid for j in 1:N]
y_norm     = [(j - 0.5) / N for j in 1:N]

## Horizontal centreline: uy(x) at y = N/2
uy_profile = [uy[i, mid] / u_lid for i in 1:N]
x_norm     = [(i - 0.5) / N for i in 1:N]

# ---
#
# ## Results --- Centreline Profiles
#
# The left panel shows the horizontal velocity ``u_x / u_\text{lid}`` along
# the vertical centreline (``x = N/2``).  At the top (``y/N = 1``), the
# velocity equals the lid speed; at the bottom wall it is zero.  The
# negative values in the lower part of the cavity correspond to the return
# flow of the primary vortex.
#
# The right panel shows the vertical velocity ``u_y / u_\text{lid}`` along
# the horizontal centreline (``y = N/2``).  This profile is antisymmetric,
# with positive values on the left (upward flow) and negative on the right
# (downward flow).
#
# The LBM results (solid lines) closely match the Ghia reference data (red
# circles) at ``N = 128``.
#

Right: vertical velocity along the horizontal centreline.  The LBM solution (N = 128) shows excellent agreement with the reference data.](cavity_centerlines.svg)
#

#
# ## Results --- Velocity Magnitude
#
# The velocity magnitude field ``|\mathbf{u}| / u_\text{lid}`` reveals the
# structure of the primary vortex.  The fastest flow is near the lid (top),
# and a thin boundary layer forms along the moving wall.  The vortex core
# is visible as a local minimum in velocity magnitude near the centre of
# the cavity.

#
# ---
#
# ## Discussion
#
# ### Boundary condition role
#
# The choice of boundary conditions is critical in cavity flows:
#
# - **Zou--He** on the lid accurately imposes ``u_x = u_\text{lid}`` by
#   solving for the unknown populations using the known velocity and the
#   bounce-back assumption for the non-equilibrium part.  This avoids the
#   pressure singularity at the top corners.
# - **Half-way bounce-back** on the three stationary walls places the
#   effective no-slip plane at distance ``\Delta x / 2`` from the boundary
#   node, giving second-order accuracy in space.
#
# ### Convergence behaviour
#
# With the BGK collision operator, the LBM is second-order accurate in
# space.  Doubling the resolution ``N`` reduces the ``L_2`` error on the
# centreline profiles by roughly a factor of 4, consistent with
# ``O(\Delta x^2)`` convergence.  At ``N = 128``, the maximum pointwise
# error against the Ghia data is typically below 1%.
#
# ### Higher Reynolds numbers
#
# To simulate higher Re (e.g. 400, 1000, 3200), increase ``N``
# proportionally to maintain stability (``\omega < 2`` requires
# ``\nu > 1/6``, so ``N > \text{Re} \cdot u_\text{lid} / (1/6)``).
# At Re = 1000, secondary and tertiary corner vortices become clearly
# visible, and the primary vortex is noticeably shifted.

#
# ## Problem Statement (3D)
#
# This section extends the classic 2D lid-driven cavity above to **three
# dimensions** using the D3Q19 lattice.  While the physics is conceptually
# identical --- a moving lid drives a recirculating flow inside a closed
# box --- the 3D case is dramatically more expensive (``N^3`` nodes instead
# of ``N^2``) and exercises a completely different lattice topology.
#
# ### From D2Q9 to D3Q19
#
# In 2D, each node has 9 neighbours (including itself).  In 3D, the D3Q19
# lattice uses **19 velocity directions**: 1 rest + 6 face-connected + 12
# edge-connected neighbours.  This is the standard choice for 3D LBM
# because it provides a good balance between accuracy and memory cost (the
# D3Q27 lattice adds 8 corner directions but requires 42% more memory per
# node).
#
# The streaming, collision, and boundary condition kernels all have 3D
# counterparts.  The key difference is that the Zou--He velocity BC must
# now handle a 2D face (``N \times N`` nodes on the lid) instead of a 1D
# line.
#
# ### What to expect
#
# At ``\text{Re} = 100`` the 3D flow is qualitatively similar to 2D: a
# single primary vortex fills the cavity.  However, the 3D solution also
# has **secondary flows in the spanwise direction** (perpendicular to the
# lid motion) that are absent in 2D.  These are weak at Re = 100 but become
# significant at higher Reynolds numbers.
#

#
# ## LBM Setup (3D)
#
# | Parameter | Value |
# |-----------|-------|
# | Lattice   | D3Q19 |
# | Domain    | ``24 \times 24 \times 24`` |
# | Lid BC    | Zou--He velocity at ``j = N_y`` (lid moves in ``x``) |
# | Other walls | Half-way bounce-back |
# | ``\text{Re}`` | 100 |
# | ``u_\text{lid}`` | 0.1 |
# | ``\nu``   | ``u_\text{lid} \cdot N / \text{Re} = 0.024`` |
# | Steps     | 30 000 |
#
# We deliberately use a **coarse grid** (``N = 24``) to keep the
# documentation build fast.  This is sufficient to capture the primary
# vortex qualitatively, but production runs should use ``N \ge 64`` for
# quantitative validation against reference data.
#
# !!! note "Memory scaling"
#     A D3Q19 simulation with ``N^3`` nodes stores 19 populations per node
#     (double precision).  At ``N = 64`` this is already
#     ``19 \times 64^3 \times 8 \approx 40`` MB for a single distribution
#     array.  At ``N = 256`` it exceeds 40 GB.  This is why 3D LBM
#     almost always requires GPU acceleration.

                   max_steps=30000, output_interval=10000)
ρ, ux, uy, uz, _ = run_cavity_3d(config)

# The function `run_cavity_3d` performs exactly the same algorithmic steps
# as the 2D version:
# 1. **Stream** --- propagate 19 populations to neighbours in 3D
# 2. **Bounce-back** on the five stationary walls (bottom, front, back,
#    left, right)
# 3. **Zou--He** on the top face (impose ``u_x = u_\text{lid}``,
#    ``u_y = u_z = 0``)
# 4. **Collide** --- BGK relaxation
# 5. **Compute macroscopic** fields ``\rho``, ``u_x``, ``u_y``, ``u_z``
#

#
# ## Post-processing (3D)
#
# We extract the velocity magnitude in the **mid-plane** at ``z = N/2``
# to visualise the primary vortex, and the vertical centreline profile
# ``u_x(y)`` at ``(x, z) = (N/2, N/2)`` for comparison with 2D results.

for j in 1:N, i in 1:N
    umag[i, j] = sqrt(ux[i, j, mid]^2 + uy[i, j, mid]^2 + uz[i, j, mid]^2)

# ## Results --- Mid-plane Velocity Magnitude (3D)
#
# The heatmap below shows ``|\mathbf{u}| / u_\text{lid}`` in the ``z = N/2``
# plane.  Even on this coarse 24^3 grid, the primary vortex structure is
# clearly visible: fast flow near the lid, a relatively quiet core, and
# return flow along the bottom.
#
# At this resolution the vortex is slightly less well-defined than in the
# 2D case because of the limited number of grid points.  The spanwise
# confinement (walls at ``z = 1`` and ``z = N``) also modifies the flow
# compared to the infinite-span 2D solution.

#
# ---
#
# ## Discussion (3D)
#
# ### 3D vs 2D differences
#
# - The mid-plane profile of the 3D cavity at Re = 100 is qualitatively
#   similar to the 2D solution, but quantitatively different because of
#   the no-slip walls at ``z = 1`` and ``z = N`` that slow down the flow
#   in the spanwise direction.
# - At ``N = 24``, the vertical centreline profile ``u_x(y)`` shows the
#   same S-shaped structure as in 2D (positive near the lid, negative
#   in the return flow), but the magnitudes are slightly reduced due to
#   the 3D wall friction.
#
# ### When to use 3D
#
# For most validation purposes, the 2D cavity is sufficient (and much
# cheaper).  The 3D version is useful for:
# - Validating the D3Q19 streaming and collision kernels
# - Testing the 3D Zou--He boundary condition
# - Benchmarking GPU performance (the 3D problem has much higher
#   arithmetic intensity and better GPU utilisation)
#
# ### Grid resolution guidelines
