# Capillary Wave --- Surface Tension Validation


## Problem Statement

The capillary wave test is the **most important validation case** for any
multiphase flow solver with surface tension.  A small-amplitude sinusoidal
perturbation of a flat interface between two fluids relaxes under surface
tension into a damped oscillation.  [Prosperetti (1981)](@cite
prosperetti1981motion) derived the exact analytical solution for the
amplitude decay, providing a rigorous reference for both the oscillation
frequency and the viscous damping rate.

The analytical solution for the interface position is:

```math
h(x, t) = \frac{H}{2} + a_0 \cos(kx)\, e^{-\gamma t}\, \cos(\omega t)
```

with wavenumber ``k = 2\pi/\lambda``, and the dispersion relation:

```math
\omega^2 = \frac{\sigma\, k^3}{\rho_l + \rho_g}, \qquad
\gamma = 2\nu\, k^2
```

The **frequency** ``\omega`` depends on surface tension ``\sigma`` and the
fluid densities, while the **damping rate** ``\gamma`` depends on the
kinematic viscosity ``\nu``.  Matching both simultaneously validates the
complete multiphase solver pipeline.

### Why this test matters --- the full coupling

Unlike the previous advection-only tests (Zalesak, reversed vortex), the
capillary wave is a **fully coupled** simulation.  Every component of the
two-phase LBM solver is exercised simultaneously:

1. **Streaming**: lattice Boltzmann populations propagate on the D2Q9 lattice
2. **Macroscopic computation**: density ``\rho`` and velocity
   ``\mathbf{u}`` are extracted from the populations
3. **VOF advection**: the volume fraction ``C`` is transported by the
   computed velocity field using the directional-split scheme
4. **Curvature computation**: the interface curvature ``\kappa`` is computed
   from the ``C`` field using the height-function (HF) method --- the most
   accurate curvature estimator for VOF on Cartesian grids
5. **Surface tension force**: the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) model
   [Brackbill *et al.* (1992)](@cite brackbill1992continuum) converts
   curvature into a volumetric body force:
   ``\mathbf{F}_\sigma = \sigma\,\kappa\,\nabla C``
6. **Two-phase collision**: the BGK collision uses local density
   ``\rho = C\,\rho_l + (1-C)\,\rho_g`` and incorporates the surface
   tension force via the Guo forcing scheme

If any of these components is incorrect --- wrong curvature, wrong force
localisation, wrong density interpolation --- the oscillation frequency
and/or damping will deviate from the analytical solution.  This makes the
capillary wave an extremely sensitive diagnostic.

## Geometry

A sinusoidally perturbed interface separates a heavy fluid (bottom,
``\rho_l = 1.0``) from a light fluid (top, ``\rho_g = 0.1``) in a
``\lambda \times 2\lambda`` periodic domain.  The perturbation amplitude
``a_0 = 1`` lattice unit is small compared to the wavelength
``\lambda = N_x = 128``.

## Code

We use the low-level driver to track the interface position at a probe
point (``x = N_x/2``) every 5 steps, building the amplitude time series
for comparison with the analytical solution.

## Results --- Oscillation vs Analytical Solution

![Interface displacement a(t) at the probe point x = Nx/2.  Black line: Prosperetti (1981) analytical solution.  Blue dots: LBM-VOF simulation.  The solver correctly captures both the oscillation frequency (controlled by surface tension) and the viscous damping (controlled by viscosity).](capwave_oscillation.svg)

The LBM-VOF solution closely matches the analytical prediction for both the
oscillation period and the damping envelope.  A small phase drift
accumulates over time due to the discrete curvature approximation: the
height-function method introduces a slight ``O(h^2)`` error in ``\kappa``,
which shifts ``\omega`` by a corresponding amount.  This phase error
decreases with grid refinement.

The fact that the damping is correctly captured confirms that the viscous
dissipation in the two-phase BGK collision is consistent with the
prescribed ``\nu``.  An incorrect density interpolation (e.g., arithmetic
vs harmonic mean) would produce the wrong effective viscosity and shift the
damping rate.

## Final Interface and Velocity Field

![Left: VOF field C at the end of the simulation, showing the nearly flat interface with residual perturbation.  Right: velocity magnitude field showing that residual velocities are concentrated near the interface.](capwave_final.svg)

After several oscillation periods, the amplitude has decayed significantly.
The residual velocity field shows that flow activity is confined to a narrow
band around the interface, consistent with the surface-tension-driven nature
of the problem.  The interior of each phase is essentially quiescent.

---

## Analytical Parameters

For reference, the dispersion relation gives:

```julia
println("Oscillation period T = ", round(T_osc, digits=1), " steps")
println("Frequency  ω = ", round(ω_ana, digits=6), " rad/step")
println("Damping    γ = ", round(γ_ana, digits=6), " /step")
```

These values can be used to design the simulation: the domain must be run
for at least ``2``--``3`` oscillation periods to observe meaningful damping,
and the time step must resolve the oscillation (at least 20 steps per
period).
