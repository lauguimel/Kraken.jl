# Thermal Natural Convection Tutorial

This tutorial adds heat to the cavity: a **differentially-heated square cavity**,
where a hot wall and a cold wall drive a buoyant circulation. It is the hands-on
companion to the
[thermal natural-convection benchmark page](../benchmarks/thermal-natural-convection.md),
which carries the quantitative validation against the de Vahl Davis (1983)
reference.

## The problem

A square cavity with a **hot left wall** (`T = 1`) and a **cold right wall**
(`T = 0`); the top and bottom walls are **adiabatic** (insulated, zero
temperature-gradient). All four walls are no-slip. Gravity acts downward. Fluid
near the hot wall expands, rises, crosses the top, cools at the cold wall, and
sinks — a single convection cell. The dimensionless driver is the Rayleigh number
`Ra` (with Prandtl number `Pr = 0.71` for air); we run `Ra = 10³, 10⁴, 10⁵`.

Kraken solves this with a **double-distribution thermal LBM**: the usual D2Q9 BGK
distribution carries momentum, a second D2Q9 distribution advects temperature, and
buoyancy is fed back into the flow through a Boussinesq body force
`F = ρ β g (T − T₀)`. The driver is `run_natural_convection_2d`, selected
automatically when the `thermal` module is active.

The west wall is a hot Dirichlet wall (T = 1, red hatched no-slip) and the east wall a cold Dirichlet wall (T = 0, blue hatched no-slip); the north and south walls are adiabatic no-slip walls (∂ₙT = 0, grey hatched).  Gravity acts downward (grey arrow).](thermal-natural-convection-bc.svg)

## The `.krk` file

The thermal module is activated with `Module thermal`; the hot/cold walls are
plain `wall` boundaries carrying a `T = ...` Dirichlet value, and the insulated
walls are walls with no `T` (zero-gradient by default). A self-contained
differentially-heated cavity reads:

```
# Differentially-heated square cavity (natural convection)
# Validation: de Vahl Davis (1983), Pr = 0.71

Simulation natural_convection D2Q9
Domain L = 1.0 x 1.0  N = 192 x 192
Physics nu = 0.02 Pr = 0.71 Ra = 1e3

Module thermal

Boundary west  wall T = 1.0     # hot
Boundary east  wall T = 0.0     # cold
Boundary south wall             # adiabatic (no T → zero-gradient)
Boundary north wall             # adiabatic

Run 270000 steps
Output vtk every 30000 [rho, ux, uy, T]
```

The `T = ...` syntax on a `wall` is exactly the pattern used by the bundled
`examples/heat_conduction.krk` case (hot west wall, cold east wall) — see the
[KRK reference](../krk-reference.md) for the boundary grammar. The
thermal coefficients live in `Physics`: `Pr` and `Ra` set the regime; the driver
derives the thermal diffusivity and the Boussinesq force from them.

### Choosing resolution and precision per Rayleigh number

The benchmark page documents a real finding: the thermal boundary layer thins as
`Ra^(1/4)`, so the mesh needed to clear the 1 % Nusselt gate grows with `Ra`, and
**`Ra = 10³` must be run in Float64** (its buoyancy force `β g ∝ 1/N³ ≈ 10⁻⁹` LU
underflows Float32 for `N ≥ 320`). The validated settings are:

| Ra   | Mesh  | Backend     | Steps to steady |
|------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| 10³  | 192²  | CPU F64     | 270 000         |
| 10⁴  | 320²  | Metal F32   | 500 000         |
| 10⁵  | 384²  | Metal F32   | 2 160 000       |

Match the `Domain N`, the backend, and the `Run` length to the row you want to
reproduce.

## Running it

```julia
using Kraken
run_simulation("natural_convection.krk")
```

The runner sees `Module thermal`, dispatches to `run_natural_convection_2d`,
iterates the coupled flow+temperature solve, and writes `output/*.vtr` snapshots
carrying `T` alongside the velocity. Open them in ParaView and colour by `T` to see
the thermal plume and the convection cell.

!!! note "Reproducing exact benchmark numbers"
    The benchmark page reproduces its table with the driver settings above (CPU
    Float64 at `Ra = 10³`; Metal Float32 at `Ra = 10⁴/10⁵`). Run the longer step
    counts and the matching backend to land on the published Nusselt values.

## A qualitative variant: Rayleigh–Bénard

For a hot-**bottom** / cold-**top** cell with periodic sides — Rayleigh–Bénard
convection — Kraken ships a ready preset and example, `examples/rayleigh_benard.krk`:

```
Preset rayleigh_benard_2d
Run 30000 steps
Output vtk every 5000 [rho, ux, uy, T]
```

```julia
run_simulation("examples/rayleigh_benard.krk")
```

This develops the expected convection rolls above the critical `Ra_c ≈ 1708`. As
the benchmark page states, the Rayleigh–Bénard demo is **qualitative only** — no
quantitative roll-cell reference is asserted.

## Expected result

At steady state the differentially-heated cavity shows a single clockwise (hot-left)
convection cell, with thin thermal boundary layers hugging the hot and cold walls
that sharpen as `Ra` increases. The headline metric is the average **Nusselt
number** `Nu` on the hot wall (the dimensionless wall heat flux). As reported on the
[benchmark page](../benchmarks/thermal-natural-convection.md), Kraken lands at a
Nu error of **+0.79 % / +0.93 % / +0.79 %** at `Ra = 10³ / 10⁴ / 10⁵` versus de
Vahl Davis 1983, with both mid-plane velocity extrema under 1 %. OpenFOAM
`buoyantBoussinesqSimpleFoam` independently corroborates the reference at the
flanking `Ra = 10³` (−0.56 %) and `Ra = 10⁵` (−0.60 %).

The same double-distribution method extends to a **3D cubic cavity** (`D3Q19` flow
+ `D3Q19` temperature, driver `run_natural_convection_3d`); the benchmark page
tabulates its monotone mesh convergence toward the Tric et al. (2000) spectral
reference.
