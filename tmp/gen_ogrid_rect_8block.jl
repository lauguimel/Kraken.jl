# Programmatic generator for the 8-block O-grid-in-rectangle topology
# targeting approach (E-full) in the WP-MESH-6 paper matrix.
#
# Layout:
#   - Cylinder at (cx_p, cy_p), radius R_in
#   - 8 cylinder-surface points at 45° intervals: p_0 (0°), p_1 (45°),
#     p_2 (90°), ..., p_7 (315°)
#   - 8 matching outer points on the rectangle boundary (`q_k`):
#         k=0 → (Lx, cy_p)     east-midpoint
#         k=1 → (Lx, Ly)       NE corner
#         k=2 → (cx_p, Ly)     top-midpoint
#         k=3 → (0, Ly)        NW corner
#         k=4 → (0, cy_p)      west-midpoint
#         k=5 → (0, 0)         SW corner
#         k=6 → (cx_p, 0)      bottom-midpoint
#         k=7 → (Lx, 0)        SE corner
#   - 8 Transfinite surfaces (blocks) between consecutive (p_k, q_k)
#     arrangements, each 4-sided: inner cylinder arc p_k→p_{k+1},
#     spoke p_{k+1}→q_{k+1}, outer rectangle segment q_{k+1}→q_k,
#     spoke q_k→p_k.
#
# Resulting topology:
#   - 8 blocks
#   - 16 distinct curves: 8 cylinder arcs + 8 spokes (+ 8 outer segments
#     that together cover the full rectangle perimeter)
#   - 8 shared spokes → 8 interfaces (block k.east ↔ block (k+1).west
#     in a circular chain)
#   - Physical Curves: "cylinder" (8 arcs), "inlet" (q_3→q_4, q_4→q_5),
#     "outlet" (q_7→q_0, q_0→q_1), "wall_top" (q_1→q_2, q_2→q_3),
#     "wall_bot" (q_5→q_6, q_6→q_7).
#   - Physical Surfaces: "ring_0" .. "ring_7".
#
# The generator is exposed as a function `write_ogrid_rect_8block_geo`
# so a driver can use it in-process via `mktempdir`.

Write an 8-block O-grid-in-rectangle `.geo` file at `path`. Each of the
8 blocks has `N_arc` cells along its cylinder arc (ξ direction) and
`N_radial` cells along its radial spoke (η direction), so the total
cell count is `8 * N_arc * N_radial`.

Use the resulting `.geo` with `load_gmsh_multiblock_2d(path)` to
obtain a `MultiBlockMesh2D` with 8 blocks + 8 interfaces.
